      This is a footer. Which should come to every webpage's bottommost part.
      
      Change the content in the footer according to your site. 
      
      But keep the enter email for subscription button and input field. You can change the content of it (like chage newsletter to blog subscription etc.) but that input field must be there.

      Change the colors if you want. 

      Just remember, an input field for subscription feature and minimum 2 columns (Here in sample footer there are 3; Gallery, Marketplace, Magazine) must be there. 

      You can change other things (colors, links, texts and hrefs in columns etc.) :-)
